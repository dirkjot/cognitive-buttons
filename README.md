Cognitive Buttons
================


An illustration of a Cognitive Science experiment: Participants will view 
a stream of words (nouns) and have to decide on the semantic category of
each noun as fast as they can.  There are 2 versions of the experiment,
which differ in the size and placement of the buttons.   After all words
have been displayed, the average RT (reaction time) is shown. 

This is a webapp in ELM, designed to run on Pivotal Cloud Foundry.  Heroku
should work too, and ELM is just javascript.
